# Claim & Regain

![Claim & Regain](link-to-screenshot-here)

A lost & found tracking system for high-traffic spaces like schools, gyms, and event venues. Claim & Regain helps venues safely track lost property and return items to their rightful owners through a verification-based claiming process.

## Description

Claim & Regain solves the problem of managing lost items in busy venues where theft and false claims are concerns. Staff can log found items with private verification questions, while visitors browse vague public listings and prove ownership by answering specific questions. This prevents theft while ensuring legitimate owners can reclaim their belongings.
